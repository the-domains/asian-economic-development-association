            <description><![CDATA[<p>AEDA's mission is to increase economic opportunities for Asian Americans. Asian Economic Development Association was created to expand opportunities for economic success for low-income Asian Americans in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Twin Cities. Our programs help lift people out of poverty and achieve economic stability. We focus on helping our communities create jobs through small business development; achieve financial capability through financial education and access to credit; champion more vibrant neighborhoods through arts and culture; and attain racial justice and economic inclusion through advocacy.</p>]]></description>
